# ProbabilitySolitaire
Basic simulation to calculate the probability in a solitaire.

## Rules
This solitaire is played with a 40-card deck. You begin by drawing three cards from the deck and placing them in a row. If the third card has the same suit or the same rank as the first card, you place the second card on top of the first one, creating a bigger pile of 2 cards.

You then draw a fourth card and continue placing cards in a row, always checking whether there are two piles with exactly one pile in between them whose top card share the same suit or the same rank. If so, you move the middle pile on top of the earlier one.

Note that when a pile is moved in this way, it may now be adjacent to earlier piles, which can trigger further moves in a chain reaction.

The game is won if, when the deck is exhausted, only two piles remain on the table.
